# GameVersion
Unreal Engine Plugin with utilities for project versioning, package versioning, and build numbers
(This plugin is in an early development stage and will receive updates and changes ad hoc)

### Features
This plugin allows developers to fetch the latest build information for their game from a static version service endpoint that hosts a JSON file containing such information.
This plugin will parse that information, populate custom data types, and allow developers to compare the current version of the client build to the latest one and determine what user-facing action needs to happen. 
This plugin also contains the necessary utilities to assign version numbers and other information of that sort to builds of a project and make integration with CI/CD systems easier.
